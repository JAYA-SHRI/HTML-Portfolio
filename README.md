# HTML-Portfolio
A beginner HTML portfolio with no style or js, built as part of my web development learning. It includes my intro, contact info, and two projects: a Birthday Invite page and a Movie List page. Simple structure, easy navigation, and hosted on GitHub Pages to share my work and track my progress as I learn.
