<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>👋🏽 Hey, I'm Jayashri D — a curious and driven Computer Science student, currently in my second year, exploring the vast world of Full Stack Development. I'm passionate about building digital experiences that are not just functional but also meaningful and user-focused.</p>

<p>With a foundation in HTML, CSS, C, and Python, I've started translating my learning into hands-on practice. One of my first steps was creating a recipe website, and that experience sparked my enthusiasm to keep building, experimenting, and learning more every day.</p>



<h3><p>🧠 Skills & Technologies</p></h3>

C -> for sharpening logic and developing a deep problem-solving mindset

Python -> for scripting, automation, and clean, readable code

HTML & CSS -> for crafting clean, responsive web layouts
</p>




<h3><p>📚 Learning & Certifications</p></h3>

I'm committed to building a strong, well-rounded foundation. Here are some key certifications I've completed so far:

Cybersecurity Fundamentals from AWS, IBM, and Linux Foundation

Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel (Coursera Guided Project)


Each of these has helped me explore new areas and solidify my understanding of the tech ecosystem.

</p>


<h3><p>🎯 Vision & Goals</p>
</h3>
I'm driven by the idea of using technology to make a positive impact. Right now, I'm focused on gaining confidence in full stack development and building complete applications — from frontend to backend.

In the long run, I aim to:

Contribute to open-source projects

Intern at leading tech companies

Dive deeper into web security, frontend frameworks, or tech for social good.

</p>


<h3><p>🌐 Let's Connect & Grow Together</p></h3>

I love connecting with like-minded people, sharing what I learn, and staying inspired by the journeys of others in tech. If you're into building, learning, or collaborating — I’d love to hear from you!
